description: Restore a previous project version
---

You are restoring a previous version of the project. Follow these steps:

1. Show user list of available versions from `versions/VERSION_LOG.md`
2. Ask which version they want to restore
3. Confirm with user before proceeding (this will overwrite current files!)
4. Copy files from `versions/v{timestamp}/` back to their original locations
5. Confirm to user which version was restored
6. Suggest they review the VERSION_INFO.md to see what was in that version
