# Backend Deployment Walkthrough - Step by Step

This guide walks you through deploying your Marketstack API backend to Cloudflare Workers.

## What You're Doing

You're putting your backend code (the Marketstack proxy) onto Cloudflare's servers so your iOS app can call it from the internet.

---

## Step 1: Install Wrangler (Cloudflare's Tool)

**What is Wrangler?** It's the command-line tool that lets you deploy to Cloudflare.

### Open Terminal and run:
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

**What this does:** Installs Wrangler globally on your computer.

**Expected output:**
```
added 1 package in 3s
```

**How to verify it worked:**
```bash
wrangler --version
```
You should see something like: `wrangler 3.x.x`

---

## Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

### Navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
cd /Users/rileygibson/Documents/InvestmentResearchApp/backend
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

**What this does:** Installs the packages needed for the project.

**Expected output:**
```
added 234 packages in 5s
```

---

## Step 3: Login to Cloudflare

```bash
wrangler login
```

**What this does:** Opens your browser to log into Cloudflare.

**What will happen:**
1. Your browser will open
2. You'll see a Cloudflare login page
3. Log in with your Cloudflare account
4. Click "Allow" to give Wrangler access
5. Browser shows "You may close this window"

**Expected terminal output:**
```
 ‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 3.x.x
‚ñ≤ Opening a link in your default browser: https://dash.cloudflare.com/...
‚ú® Successfully logged in.
```

**Don't have a Cloudflare account?**
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up
2. Sign up (it's free)
3. Then run `wrangler login` again

---

## Step 4: Create a Storage Space (KV Namespace)

**What is KV?** It's Cloudflare's key-value storage - think of it as a cache/database for your API responses.

### Create the production namespace:
```bash
wrangler kv:namespace create "CACHE"
```

**Expected output:**
```
üåÄ Creating namespace with title "stock-research-api-CACHE"
‚ú® Success!
Add the following to your configuration file in your kv_namespaces array:
{ binding = "CACHE", id = "abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345" }
```

### Create the preview namespace (for testing):
```bash
wrangler kv:namespace create "CACHE" --preview
```

**Expected output:**
```
üåÄ Creating namespace with title "stock-research-api-CACHE_preview"
‚ú® Success!
Add the following to your configuration file in your kv_namespaces array:
{ binding = "CACHE", preview_id = "xyz987wvu654tsr321qpo098nml765" }
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Copy these IDs!
You'll get two IDs that look like random letters and numbers:
- **id**: `abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345` (for production)
- **preview_id**: `xyz987wvu654tsr321qpo098nml765` (for testing)

**Write these down or keep the terminal open!**

---

## Step 5: Update Configuration with KV IDs

Now you need to put those IDs into your config file.

### Open the config file:
```bash
open wrangler.toml
```

This will open the file in your default text editor.

### Find this section:
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "CACHE"
id = "your_kv_namespace_id_here"
```

### Replace it with YOUR IDs:
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "CACHE"
id = "abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345"
preview_id = "xyz987wvu654tsr321qpo098nml765"
```

**Use the ACTUAL IDs from Step 4!** (not the examples above)

### Save the file and close it

---

## Step 6: Store Your API Key Securely

This stores your Marketstack API key on Cloudflare (encrypted, never visible).

```bash
wrangler secret put MARKETSTACK_API_KEY
```

**What will happen:**
```
Enter a secret value:
```

**Type this exactly:**
```
9dba12fdfa1a0d703eeec5a6123044f1
```

Then press Enter.

**Expected output:**
```
üåÄ Creating the secret for the Worker "stock-research-api"
‚ú® Success! Uploaded secret MARKETSTACK_API_KEY
```

**What this does:** Stores your API key on Cloudflare's servers (encrypted). Your worker can use it, but no one can see it.

---

## Step 7: Test Locally (Optional but Recommended)

Before deploying to the internet, test it on your computer.

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 3.x.x
Your worker has access to the following bindings:
- KV Namespaces:
  - CACHE: xyz987wvu654tsr321qpo098nml765
‚éî Starting local server...
[wrangler:inf] Ready on http://localhost:8787
```

**Leave this running and open a NEW terminal window.**

### In the new terminal, test it:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/api/health
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2024-10-26T..."}
```

### Test a real stock quote:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/api/quote/AAPL
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "currentPrice": 178.50,
  "change": 1.25,
  ...
}
```

**If these work, you're ready to deploy!**

Go back to the first terminal and press `Ctrl+C` to stop the local server.

---

## Step 8: Deploy to Cloudflare

This is the big moment - putting your code live on the internet!

```bash
npm run deploy
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 3.x.x
Total Upload: 2.34 KiB / gzip: 0.95 KiB
Uploaded stock-research-api (1.23 sec)
Published stock-research-api (0.45 sec)
  https://stock-research-api.YOURNAME.workers.dev
Current Deployment ID: abcd1234-5678-90ef-ghij-klmnopqrstuv
```

**Look for the URL!** It will be something like:
```
https://stock-research-api.YOURNAME.workers.dev
```

**Copy this URL - you'll need it for your iOS app!**

---

## Step 9: Test Your Live Deployment

Replace `YOUR_WORKER_URL` with the URL from Step 8:

```bash
curl https://stock-research-api.YOURNAME.workers.dev/api/health
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2024-10-26T..."}
```

### Test a real quote:
```bash
curl https://stock-research-api.YOURNAME.workers.dev/api/quote/AAPL
```

**If this returns stock data, YOU'RE DONE!** üéâ

---

## Step 10: Update Your iOS App (If URL is Different)

**Only if** your worker URL is different from `https://my-stock-api.stock-research-api.workers.dev`:

### Open this file in Xcode:
`ios/Test App/MarketDataService.swift`

### Find this line (line 8):
```swift
init(apiBaseURL: String = "https://my-stock-api.stock-research-api.workers.dev") {
```

### Replace with YOUR worker URL:
```swift
init(apiBaseURL: String = "https://stock-research-api.YOURNAME.workers.dev") {
```

### Save and rebuild your iOS app.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "wrangler: command not found"
**Solution:** Install Wrangler:
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

### "You must be logged in"
**Solution:** Run:
```bash
wrangler login
```

### "KV namespace not found"
**Solution:** Make sure you:
1. Ran `wrangler kv:namespace create "CACHE"`
2. Copied the ID into `wrangler.toml`
3. Saved the file

### "Secret not found"
**Solution:** Run:
```bash
wrangler secret put MARKETSTACK_API_KEY
```
Enter: `9dba12fdfa1a0d703eeec5a6123044f1`

### "Cannot find module"
**Solution:** Run:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### "Network error" when testing
**Solution:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try the deploy again: `npm run deploy`

## What You've Accomplished

‚úÖ Installed Cloudflare's deployment tool (Wrangler)
‚úÖ Created a cache storage space (KV Namespace)
‚úÖ Configured your worker with the cache IDs
‚úÖ Stored your API key securely
‚úÖ Deployed your code to Cloudflare's global network
‚úÖ Your API is now live on the internet!

Your iOS app can now call:
- `https://YOUR_WORKER_URL/api/quote/AAPL`
- `https://YOUR_WORKER_URL/api/eod/AAPL?limit=30`
- `https://YOUR_WORKER_URL/api/intraday/AAPL`

---

## Next Steps

1. **Add MarketDataService.swift to Xcode**
   - Drag `ios/Test App/MarketDataService.swift` into your Xcode project

2. **Update the URL if needed** (see Step 10)

3. **Use it in your app:**
   ```swift
   let marketData = MarketDataService()
   let quote = try await marketData.fetchQuote(symbol: "AAPL")
   ```

---

## Monitoring Your Worker

### View live requests:
```bash
cd backend
npm run tail
```

This shows you real-time logs of requests hitting your worker.

### View analytics:
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click "Workers & Pages"
3. Click "stock-research-api"
4. See graphs of requests, errors, CPU time

---

## Costs

- **Cloudflare Workers**: FREE (100,000 requests per day)
- **Cloudflare KV**: FREE (100,000 reads per day)
- **Marketstack API**: Depends on your plan

With caching, you'll likely stay in the free tier for both Cloudflare services!
